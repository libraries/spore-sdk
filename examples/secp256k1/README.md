# Spore Default Lock Examples

## Introduction

### What is `CKB Default Lock`

[CKB Default Lock](https://www.notion.so/cryptape/examples/secp256k1) is the most commonly used lock script on [Nervos CKB](https://www.nervos.org/), also a great starting point for beginners due to its simplicity. You can create private spores and clusters with the [CKB Default Lock](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c) for safeguarding ownership of your private assets.

[CKB Default Lock](https://www.notion.so/cryptape/examples/secp256k1) is also known as the `Secp256k1Blake160 Sign-all` lock.

### Featured examples

Spore:
- [apis/createSpore.ts](./apis/createSpore.ts): Create a spore with [CKB Default Lock](https://www.notion.so/cryptape/examples/secp256k1)
- [apis/transferSpore.ts](./apis/transferSpore.ts): Unlock and transfer a spore from A to B
- [apis/meltSpore.ts](./apis/meltSpore.ts): Unlock and melt a spore from the blockchain

Cluster:
- [apis/createCluster.ts](./apis/createCluster.ts): Create a cluster with [CKB Default Lock](https://www.notion.so/cryptape/examples/secp256k1)
- [apis/transferCluster.ts](./apis/transferCluster.ts): Unlock and transfer a cluster from A to B

## Run examples

> Please make sure you've met the pre-requirements:
> [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18.0.0
> [`PNPM`](https://pnpm.io/) >= 8.0.0

### Setup environment

To set up the local environment, run the following command at the root of the Spore SDK:

```shell
pnpm i && pnpm run build:packages
```

### Run an example

Go to the current directory (`examples/secp256k1`) and run an example:

```shell
ts-node apis/createSpore.ts
```

### Review transaction

This example constructs and sends a transaction that creates a spore on-chain. Once the transaction is sent, a `hash` value should be returned. You can later review the transaction on [CKB Explorer](https://pudge.explorer.nervos.org/):

```shell
https://pudge.explorer.nervos.org/transaction/{hash}
```

## Customization

### Update configs

If you have your own testing accounts, or if you want to configure the SporeConfig of the examples, you can go to the [examples/secp256k1/utils/config.ts](./utils/config.ts) file and update it. Inside the `utils/config.ts` file, you can:

- Replace the default testing accounts with your own
- Modify the default SporeConfig as needed

### Use your own accounts

If you want a clean startup environment for testing the functionality of the spore-sdk, you can replace the default testing accounts with your own accounts. Whether locally or in globally, there has two default testing accounts being used, `CHARLIE` and `ALICE`.

How to replace them:

- Replace locally: For replacing the testing accounts locally (only affects the secp256k1 examples), visit the [examples/secp256k1/utils/config.ts](./utils/config.ts) file and edit the `accounts` variable.
- Replace globally: If you want to replace the testing accounts globally (affects all kinds of examples), you can visit the [examples/shared/index.ts](../shared/index.ts) file and edit the `accounts` variable.

### Generate testing accounts

For those who want to create new accounts for testing the examples, you can follow the steps below to create a new private key and claim some faucet CKBytes.

**1. Generate a new account:**

1. Open the [Generator Tool](https://ckb.tools/generator) website
2. Click the refresh icon (ðŸ”„) on the page to generate a new account
3. Copy the new account's `Private Key (256-bit)` from the `Private/Public Key` block
4. Replace any of the default testing accounts with the new account

**2. Claim faucet CKBytes for the new account:**

1. Copy the new account's `Nervos CKB Address` from the `Default Lock (Secp256k1-Blake160) - Testnet` block
2. Open the [Nervos Faucet](https://faucet.nervos.org/) website
3. Paste the address into the address input, and click the `Claim` button
4. Wait for a while until the faucet process is completed
